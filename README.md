# Nexus

Nexus is an application created with the purpose of accelerating the processus of mass applying to jobs. As some experience, it often takes hundreds of applications to get a single job offer. At that pace, handing out resumes and cover letters is a full-time job in itself. With Nexus, everything will be displayed on a single screen, and you will simply need to select the jobs you wish to send your application.
